# Stat 605 Final Project

## Data Description
Our data set comes from https://www.kaggle.com/ananaymital/us-used-cars-dataset , the dataset contains details of 3 million real used cars in the United States. We want to use these data, that is, all kinds of information about used cars, to build the model and predict the price of used cars. To assure randomness, we split the dataset into ten subsets based on the last digit of the zip code provided in each row.

## Statistical Methods

## Data description
Our task is to explore the relationship between the price of used cars and all kinds of information about used cars. The data set comes from https://www.kaggle.com/ananaymital/us-used-cars-dataset , which contains details of 3 million real used cars, including their brand, power and fuel, loss, and certificate information etc. We separate the files according to the last bit of “dealer_zipcode”.

### Dependent Variable
price

### Predicator Variables:
#### Basic information of the vehicle
Brand: make_name

Capacity: back_legroom/front_legroom/body_type/maximum_seating

Engine: engine_type

Transmission type: transmission/transmission_display

Wheel: wheel_system/wheelbase

#### Power and fuel
Power: horsepower

Fuel: combine_fuel_economy/fuel_tank_volume/fuel_type

#### Loss
Accident: has_accidents/vehicle_damage_category/theft_title: 

Use: year/is_new

#### Certificate
Certificate:is_certified

## Statistical methods
After performing feature engineering processing on the variables, we use multiple linear regression model to predict the price of cars.

## Computational Steps
1. Data-Preprocessing and feature engineering
    1. Use common sense to filter variables that are not related to car prices.
    2. Deal with missing values and outliers.
    3. Delete the columns with high multi-collinearity.
    4. Use label encoding and one-hot encoding to transform the categorical variables.
2. Split the data based on the last digit of zipcode
3. Run parallel jobs to fit the data with MLR models
4. Average the coefficients after we get the result of 10 separate models.

## Reading Data
```{r}
header_desired <- c("price", "make_name", "exterior_color", "interior_color", "back_legroom", "front_legroom", "body_type", "maximum_seating", "engine_type", "transmission", "transmission_display", "wheel_system", "wheelbase", "torque", "horsepower", "combine_fuel_economy", "fuel_tank_volume", "fuel_type", "has_accidents", "vehicle_damage_category", "year", "is_new", "theft_title", "is_certified")


header <- colnames(read.csv(text = readLines("used_cars_data.csv", n = 1)))
idx <- match(header_desired, header)
print(idx)
cat(idx, file = "col_index.txt")
```
```{bash eval = FALSE}
