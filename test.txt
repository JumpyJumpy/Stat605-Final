Source: Edmunds   * The 2014 INFINITI Q60 Convertible is the right choice for those looking for the ultimate in sporty luxury. The Q60 is the new moniker for the previous generation INFINITI G37 Coupe and Convertible. The Q60's 3.7 liter V6 unleashes 328-hp and features exclusive VVEL technology that continually tunes valve lift and timing for quicker response and broader torque curve, even while improving fuel economy and emissions. IPL models feature a 348-hp 3.7-liter IPL-tuned V6 with 276 lb-ft of torque. The high 7th gear allows lower-rpm cruising for greater fuel efficiency. Shift through all seven seamlessly in automatic mode, the 11-speaker INFINITI Studio on Wheels by Bose was designed to help music retain its richly-authentic sound. INFINITI engineers created the first manufacturer system that delivers the music's power from the front, with sound washing through the cabin from front to back, as in a live performance. Your INFINITI transforms the reality of traffic with technology that will help effortlessly manage your speed and maintain your distance to the car ahead. When traffic slows, Intelligent Cruise Control will automatically slow your vehicle to help maintain a safe distance,6 Speakers,AM/FM radio: SiriusXM,CD player,Radio data system,Four wheel independent suspension,Speed-sensing steering,Dual front impact airbags,Overhead airbag,Rear anti-roll bar,Brake assist,Electronic Stability Control,Front fog lights,Fully automatic headlights,Panic alarm,Speed control
